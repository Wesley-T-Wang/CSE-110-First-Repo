```console.log('Ascend Learning Intern');```

Hi, my name is welsey and I am a third year at UCSD. I am a very active person who enjoys playing sports, namely basketball, volleyball, and badminton. I am looking forward to this class as a more open ended approach to not only learning new technologies to code with, but also gather some insight into the process of the development of that code. I hope to learn from the more collaborative and open ended structure that this class follows as opposed to those more common in traditional academia. I hope to gain experiences that mimic the internship I had and am currently continuing.
